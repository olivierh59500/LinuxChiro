==========

Posture checking and correcting for Linux

What it checks/fixes:
 - Files/folders for permissions and/or ownership
 - Config files for correct option/value settings (separator can be specified)
   - Ex: "PermitEmptyPasswords no" in sshd_config or "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1" in /etc/sysctl.conf
 - Service checks (Running and Starup Configs) 

Core functionality:
- Examination  - Audit things to be fixed, things already fixed or the status of all 
- Prescription - Produces a list of what commands that should be run to resolve issues
- Adjustment   - Fix issues interactively (locally) and non-interactively (locally/remotely) 
- Insurance    - Backs up things before making each change and creates a list of commands to run to easily undo changes

Other features:
- Runs agentless remotely via a ssh (it won't take arguments when run remotely but you can hard code the option) 
- Runs as non root and performs rudimentary check for required sudo privs (better checks coming in future version).
  - It will run as root locally but this produces a warning. 
- Checks for the availability of required commands before running. 
- Changes are made immediately active when possible and added to the appropriate files for the next service (ex sshd) restart 
- Results are compressed and saved on the host so that you can compare with old exams.
- Descriptive/Custom exit codes
- Provides brief/simple reasons for making each change
- All contained in one bash script 

Requirements:
- Runs on RHEL/Centos 5/6 (could easily work on many others, the big difference between versions is the actual checks to perform)
- Sudo privs without password (This can be trimmed down) 
- /sbin in path (This can be trimmed down, the code will check for each needed commend but things like /sbin/service are needed)
- Bash GNU bash, version 3.2.25 or later

Major Feature additions in the works:
- Ability to optionally source checks from external config files.
- RPM Package checks (Combine with Service check?)
- Ability to create and process a white list of changes that should not be made on a host 

Current Limitations:
- It will not create files that don't exist but should (ex: /etc/cron.deny). It will warn.
- It will not delete/remove options, files, services or packages that should not exist. 
  - Ex Rhost Auth option from pam files, Cron log file "/etc/cron.daily/0logwatch", telnet-server package and rsh service
  - This isn't a big deal for options in files because we can usually just set things to an appropriate value (ex null or 0) but some things need to be removed. 
  - It will warn for packages and services that should not exist, currently there is not a way to indicate files and options that should not exist
- It can't deal correctly with multiple occurrences of an option/value pair in a file (ex: two name servers in /etc/resolve.conf). It evaluates based on the value of the 2nd occurrence, which may cause issues since it could change both instances.  
- It can't deal with min/max values. It only takes exact - ex if PASS_MAX_DAYS is set to 60 in /etc/login.defs, it will warn if checking for 50 
- It will not install a service or rpm that should be present but isn't. It will warn.

Usage: ./checkup.sh audit|audit-on|audit-off|fix-quiet|fix-notify|interactive

audit-all   - make no changes, notify status of all checks
audit-on    - make no changes, notify status of only implemented checks
audit-off   - make no changes, notify status of only non-implemented checks
fix-quiet   - make changes, no notifications
fix-notify  - make changes, with notifications of changes made
interactive - step through each check, give status of all and prompt to fix (if needed)

To Dos:

-- Code Cleanup:
  -- Get rid of all the exit code status checks in the if statements, put the greps right in the If block 
  -- Put all text echos through the function (even errors), this will help keep the app quiet when needed
  -- Put a catch all "else" in every if/case statement and custom error

--Feature add:
  -- Create white list of things that should not be changed on a host. Could this be easily tied to the remediation script? Just remove the lines from the remediation script that are in the white list file???
  -- Break out config of checks to separate files
  -- Package Checking - should we remove and install packages? Check for repos?
  
-- Testing Plan:
-- Create a file to test the script during development - it could just be a set of prescribe and undo scripts 
-- Things to check in demo script 
 - Check permision on file 
 - Check ownership on folder
 - Set Permision on file 
 - Change ownership on file 
 - Set Permision on folder  
 - Change ownership on folder 
 - Check value of option in file
 - Add option to config file 
 - Restarting of service
 - Setting of Active Value 
 - Service running that should be 
 - Servive running that should not be (and does exist) 
 - Servive running that should not be (and does not exist) 
 - Service not running that should not be running
 - Check on/off notification output
 - Undoing all of the above 
 - Interactive Changes 
 - Test on different versions of RedHat/Centos

-- Etc:
-- Create Files for DISA, CIS and NIST STIG compliance 
-- SetUID/Stick bit checking?
-- Ability to set max and min for config options, Ex: --Incorrect PASS_MAX_DAYS in /etc/login.defs is set to 99999, it should be 60
-- Create a way to remove options from config files and remove files that should not exist - Ex Rhost Auth from pam files and Cron log watch spam "/etc/cron.daily/0logwatch"
-- Set old password limits by outting "remember=24" at the correct place in the correct line of /etc/pam.d/system-auth
-- Check the order of tests on a fresh install - ex config network before repo and packages, config packages before options and files perms/ownership - or just recommend to rerun script when making certain changes?
-- Allow for multiple occurrences of an option/values in a file (ex: two name servers in /etc/resolve.conf)
-- Get working examples of Apache and other apps - do in same config loop-  Ex ssl cipher strength and protocol (poodle) 
-- Add check for updates and repo - #"yum check-update/rhn_check" (probably with the package check)
-- Get it working with RHEL/Centos 7, give script the ability to check different things per OS version, maybe this is better handled with OS specific config files for the checks?
-- Allow command line changing of the backup and PRESCRIBECOMMANDSONLY options, currenlty they are hard coded. 
-- Improve the reasons given for each permisson, config and service check - they are pretty basic now
-- More elegant way to determine RedHat/Centos version
-- Lessen need on sudo as much as possible, generator a better description of exactly what sudo privs are needed
-- Improve the way that we check if the user running the script has the correct sudo privs, tirm white space etc
-- Check active sysctl values before we set then in /etc/sysctl.conf? Maybe they are the defaults and already in place. We will want to add the values to /etc/sysctl anyway but maybe we don't need to make the active change. Same with sshd and other services. Low priority 
-- Get arugments working via pipe (important for massh usage). Might be tough/impossible, may have to rename script and check $0
-- Develop a way to work with OpenScap, maybe it can convert OpenScap recommendations to config files?

Notes on Service Checks and RPMs:
These require the need for a more advanced functionality because some times the correct setting is having something not exist. 
I should looking into creating a core function that would help with this because it seems to be very repetitious
