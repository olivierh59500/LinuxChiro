==========

Posture checking and correcting for Linux

What it checks/fixes:
 - Files/folders for permissions and/or ownership
 - Config files for correct option/value settings (separator can be specified)
   - Ex: "PermitEmptyPasswords no" in sshd_config or "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1" in /etc/sysctl.conf
 - Service checks (Running and Startup Configs) 

Core functionality:
- Examination  - Audit things to be fixed, things already fixed or the status of all 
- Prescription - Produces a list of what commands that should be run to resolve issues
- Adjustment   - Fix issues interactively (locally) and non-interactively (locally/remotely) 
- Consultation - This script will try to automatically fix as much as possible but it will suggestion things that aren't easy to fix (ex having /tmp on seperate partition) 
- Insurance    - Backs up things before making each change and creates a list of commands to run to easily undo changes

Other features:
- Runs agentless remotely via a ssh (it won't take arguments when run remotely but you can hard code the option) 
- Runs as non root and performs rudimentary checks for required sudo privs (better checks coming in future version).
  - It will run as root locally (with a warning). 
- Checks for the availability of required commands before running. 
- Changes can be made immediately active when possible and added to the appropriate files for the next service (ex sshd) restart 
- Results are compressed and saved on the host so that you can compare with past exams.
- Configurable and (hopefully) descriptive exit codes
- Provides brief/simple reason for making each change
- All contained in one bash script

Requirements:
- Runs on RHEL/Centos 5/6 (could easily work on many others, the big difference between versions is the actual checks to perform)
- Sudo privs without password (This can be trimmed down) 
- /sbin in path (This can be trimmed down, the code will check for each needed commend but things like /sbin/service are needed)
- Bash GNU bash, version 3.2.25 or later

Major Feature additions in the works:
- Ability to optionally source checks from external config files.
- RPM Package checks (Combine with Service check?)
- Ability to create and process a white list of changes that should not be made on a host 

Current Limitations (some are by design) and notes:
- It will not create files that don't exist but should (ex: /etc/cron.deny). It will warn.
- It will not delete/remove options, files, services or packages that should not exist. 
  - Ex Rhost Auth option from pam files, Cron log file "/etc/cron.daily/0logwatch", telnet-server package and rsh service
  - This isn't a big deal for options in files because we can usually just set things to an appropriate value (ex null or 0) but some things need to be removed. 
  - It will warn for packages and services that should not exist, currently there is not a way to indicate files and options that should not exist
- It can't deal correctly with multiple occurrences of an option/value pair in a file (ex: two name servers in /etc/resolve.conf). It evaluates based on the value of the 2nd occurrence, which may cause issues since it could change both instances.  
- It can't deal with min/max values. It only takes exact - ex if PASS_MAX_DAYS is set to 60 in /etc/login.defs, it will warn if checking for 50 
- It will not install a service or rpm that should be present but isn't. It will warn. 
- It will add option/value pairs to the correct location in a config file, Ex below an existing line. Therefore there is an optimal order of config checks, prerequisites first. 
  - If the prerequite config (for positioning) does not exist, it will not add the option/value pair. 
  - It will not reposition an existing option/value pair. It will warn. Hopefully in the future we can reposition (thats what Chiros do!)

You are running as a non-root user with the correct sudo privs.
OSVER is 5 - Supported
Usage: ./checkup.sh audit|audit-on|audit-off|fix-quiet|fix-notify|interactive

audit-all   - make no changes, notify status of all checks
audit-on    - make no changes, notify status of only implemented checks
audit-off   - make no changes, notify status of only non-implemented checks
fix-quiet   - make changes, no notifications
fix-notify  - make changes, with notifications of changes made
interactive - step through each check, give status of all and prompt to fix (if needed)
